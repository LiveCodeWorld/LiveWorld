/*
This is the Livecode Wolrd Home stack.

Here we experiment with a minimal script-only definition of a general project home stack.
It should do everything that is needed to get the project up and running, but nothing more.
It should:

-  have no dependencies
-  not depend on script introspection
-  use robust file naming concentions
-  human readable and easy to parse in any language
-  a simple text stack that plays well with revision control

This is a new beginning.
